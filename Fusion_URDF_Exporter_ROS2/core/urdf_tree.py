    Return a URDF-compatible spanning tree and warnings for dropped joints.

    Fusion assemblies can contain closed loops or several joints targeting the
    same child occurrence. URDF cannot represent those graphs: each child link
    must have exactly one parent and the model must be a tree rooted at
    ``base_link``. This function keeps the first reachable parent-child edge
